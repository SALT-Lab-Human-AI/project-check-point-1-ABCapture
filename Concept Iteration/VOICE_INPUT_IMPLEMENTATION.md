# Voice Input Implementation Summary

## Overview

Voice input capability has been successfully implemented for the ABCapture chatbot using Groq's Whisper-large-v3 API for transcription with PII redaction of student names before sending to the LLM.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ All Core Features Complete

All implementation tasks from the plan have been completed. The voice input functionality is ready for testing.

---

## Server-Side Implementation

### 1. PII Redaction Utility (`server/utils/pii-redaction.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

- Created `redactStudentNames()` function using `redact-pii` library
- Uses `SyncRedactor` with custom regex pattern for student names
- Escapes special regex characters to prevent regex injection
- Replaces student names with `[Student]` placeholder
- Case-insensitive matching with word boundaries

**Key Features**:
- Regex-based replacement for all student names
- Handles multiple student names in transcript
- Logs redaction activity for debugging

### 2. Audio Transcription (`server/groq.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

- Added `transcribeAudio()` function for Groq Whisper API integration
- Uses `form-data` package for Node.js FormData compatibility
- Supports audio formats: webm, mp3, wav, mp4
- Model: `whisper-large-v3`
- Comprehensive error handling:
  - API authentication failures
  - Rate limit exceeded (429)
  - Invalid requests (400)
  - Network errors

**Implementation Details**:
- Dynamic FormData import for Node.js compatibility
- Content type detection from filename
- Proper headers including boundary for multipart/form-data

### 3. Transcription Endpoint (`server/routes.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

- Added `POST /api/chat/transcribe-audio` endpoint
- Uses `multer` middleware for file upload handling
- Configurations:
  - Max file size: 25MB (Groq limit)
  - In-memory storage
  - MIME type validation (audio/webm, audio/mpeg, audio/wav, audio/mp4)
- Flow:
  1. Receives audio file from client
  2. Transcribes via Groq Whisper API
  3. Fetches user's students from database
  4. Redacts student names from transcript
  5. Returns redacted transcript JSON

**Authentication**: Protected with `isAuthenticated` middleware

## Client-Side Implementation

### 1. Voice Recording Hook (`client/src/hooks/use-voice-recording.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Features**:
- Custom React hook for audio recording
- Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for microphone access
- Uses `MediaRecorder API` for audio capture
- Audio format: WebM (browser default, fallback to mp4)
- Audio quality: 128kbps (good quality, reasonable file size)

**States**:
- `idle` - Ready to record
- `recording` - Currently capturing audio
- `processing` - Sending to server for transcription
- `error` - Error occurred (permission denied, no mic, etc.)

**Error Handling**:
- Permission denied → Clear error message
- No microphone → Helpful error message
- Microphone in use → Error message
- Network errors → Error handling
- Empty transcription → Error handling

**API Integration**:
- Sends audio blob to `/api/chat/transcribe-audio` as FormData
- Receives redacted transcript
- Calls `onTranscript` callback with transcript
- Calls `onError` callback with error details

### 2. UI Integration (`client/src/components/chatbot-recording-interface.tsx`)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**UI Components Added**:
- Microphone button (Mic/MicOff icons from lucide-react)
- Visual indicators:
  - Red pulsing "Recording..." badge when recording
  - "Transcribing..." badge with spinner during processing
  - "Analyzing..." badge (existing, for ABC extraction)

**User Experience**:
- Click mic button → Start recording
- Click mic again → Stop recording and transcribe
- Text input disabled during recording/processing
- Helper text updates based on state:
  - "Recording... Click the microphone to stop"
  - "Transcribing your voice..."
  - "Type or click the microphone to use voice • Press Enter to send"
- Error messages displayed below input field

**Auto-Send Functionality**:
- Transcribed text automatically sent to chat
- No manual intervention required
- Continues with existing ABC extraction flow

## Dependencies

### Server Dependencies (Added)
- `multer@^2.0.2` - File upload middleware for Express
- `form-data@^4.0.4` - FormData implementation for Node.js
- `redact-pii@^3.4.0` - PII redaction library
- `@types/multer@^2.0.0` - TypeScript type definitions

### Client Dependencies
- No new dependencies required (uses native browser APIs)

---

## Implementation Flow

```
1. User clicks microphone button
   ↓
2. Browser requests microphone permission
   ↓
3. MediaRecorder captures audio (WebM format)
   ↓
4. User clicks microphone again to stop
   ↓
5. Audio blob sent to /api/chat/transcribe-audio
   ↓
6. Server transcribes via Groq Whisper API
   ↓
7. Server fetches user's students from database
   ↓
8. Server redacts student names from transcript
   ↓
9. Server returns redacted transcript
   ↓
10. Client auto-sends transcript as chat message
   ↓
11. ABC form auto-fills from conversation (existing flow)
```

## Privacy Architecture

### Data Flow & Privacy

1. **Audio Capture** (Client)
   - Audio recorded in browser
   - Stored temporarily in memory
   - Never saved to disk

2. **Transcription** (Groq Whisper API)
   - Audio sent to Groq Whisper for transcription
   - Whisper "hears" student names during transcription
   - This is acceptable - Whisper only transcribes, doesn't process meaning
   - Groq's terms indicate data is not used for training

3. **PII Redaction** (Server)
   - Transcript text redacted server-side
   - Student names replaced with `[Student]`
   - Redacted text never contains actual student names

4. **LLM Processing** (Groq Chat API)
   - Redacted transcript sent to main LLM
   - LLM never receives actual student names
   - ABC extraction works on redacted text

**Privacy Trade-off**: Whisper sees names for transcription, but the main LLM (that processes conversation meaning) never receives them. This is an acceptable level of privacy for educational use cases.

## Known Considerations

### redact-pii Package

- The `redact-pii@3.4.0` package shows a deprecation warning
- However, it is still fully functional
- Alternative: Consider migrating to a different PII redaction library in the future if needed

### Audio Format

- Currently captures in WebM format (browser default)
- Groq Whisper supports: webm, mp3, wav, mp4
- No conversion needed - browser format is compatible

### Real-Time Streaming

- Current implementation: Single recording (record → stop → transcribe)
- Future enhancement possible: Real-time streaming transcription
- Would require chunking audio and sending multiple requests
- More complex state management needed
