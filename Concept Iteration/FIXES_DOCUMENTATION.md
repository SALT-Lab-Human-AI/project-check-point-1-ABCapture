# ABCapture Bug Fixes & Groq Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document details the fixes for two critical issues in the ABCapture autism incident logging application:
1. **Student Data Mismatch Bug** - Wrong student data displayed in detail view
2. **Non-Functional Chatbot** - Integration with Groq AI for intelligent assistance

---

## ISSUE 1: Student Data Mismatch Bug

### Problem Description
When clicking on a student from the list, the student detail page displayed incorrect data from hardcoded mock students instead of the actual student from the database.

### Root Cause
The `student-detail.tsx` component was using static mock data arrays instead of fetching real data from the API:
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Using mock data
const mockStudents = [
  { id: "1", name: "Emma Johnson", ... },
  { id: "2", name: "Liam Martinez", ... },
];
const student = mockStudents.find((s) => s.id === studentId);
```

This meant:
- Student IDs from the database (integers) didn't match mock IDs (strings)
- Clicking any student would show data from the hardcoded mock array
- Real student data was never fetched or displayed

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added API Data Fetching
```typescript
// NEW CODE - Fetch from API
const { data: student, isLoading: studentLoading } = useQuery<ApiStudent>({
  queryKey: ["/api/students", studentId],
  enabled: !!studentId,
});

const { data: incidents = [], isLoading: incidentsLoading } = useQuery<ApiIncident[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/incidents", { studentId }],
  enabled: !!studentId,
});
```

#### 2. Dynamic Statistics Calculation
Instead of using hardcoded incident counts, the page now calculates real-time statistics:
- **Incident count**: `incidents.length`
- **Last incident**: From actual incident timestamps
- **Status**: Calculated based on incident frequency (calm/elevated/critical)
- **Behavior trends**: Generated from actual incident data over last 14 days
- **Behavior types**: Aggregated from real incident type distribution

#### 3. Loading States
Added proper loading states while data is being fetched:
```typescript
if (studentLoading || incidentsLoading) {
  return <LoadingIndicator />;
}
```

### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/student-detail.tsx` - Complete rewrite to use API data
- Added TypeScript types: `ApiStudent`, `ApiIncident`

### Testing Steps
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to "My Students"
3. Add a new student (e.g., "Test Student", Grade "5")
4. Click on the newly created student
5. **Verify**: The detail page shows the correct student name and grade
6. **Verify**: Statistics are calculated from real data (0 incidents for new student)
7. Add an incident for this student
8. **Verify**: Incident count updates to 1
9. **Verify**: Recent incidents section shows the new incident

## ISSUE 2: Non-Functional Chatbot with Groq Integration

### Problem Description
The chatbot feature existed in the UI but had no backend functionality. Messages were not processed, and no AI responses were generated.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Groq SDK Integration

Created `server/groq.ts` with two main functions:

**A. Chat Message Processing**
```typescript
export async function sendChatMessage(messages: ChatMessage[]): Promise<string>
```
- Uses Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model
- Specialized system prompt for ABC data collection
- Handles rate limiting and authentication errors
- Returns AI-generated responses

**B. ABC Data Extraction**
```typescript
export async function extractABCData(conversationMessages: ChatMessage[])
```
- Analyzes conversation history
- Extracts structured ABC components:
  - Summary
  - Antecedent
  - Behavior
  - Consequence
  - Incident Type
  - Function of Behavior
- Returns JSON-formatted data for form population

#### 2. Backend API Routes

Added two new endpoints in `server/routes.ts`:

**POST /api/chat**
- Accepts array of chat messages
- Sends to Groq API with specialized prompt
- Returns AI assistant response
- Protected by `isAuthenticated` middleware

**POST /api/chat/extract-abc**
- Accepts conversation history
- Extracts structured ABC data
- Returns formatted incident data
- Protected by `isAuthenticated` middleware

#### 3. Frontend Integration

Updated `client/src/pages/chat.tsx`:

**Real-time Chat**
- Integrated `useMutation` for sending messages
- Displays loading state while AI is thinking
- Handles errors gracefully
- Maintains conversation context

**ABC Form Generation**
- Button to extract ABC data from conversation
- Automatically populates form fields
- Switches to form tab when complete

**Student Selection**
- Fetches real students from API
- Associates conversation with selected student

### Groq AI Capabilities

The chatbot is configured to:

1. **Guide Documentation**
   - Ask clarifying questions about incidents
   - Help identify antecedents
   - Ensure objective behavior descriptions
   - Document consequences accurately

2. **Behavior Analysis**
   - Suggest possible functions of behavior
   - Identify patterns across incidents
   - Provide evidence-based insights

3. **Best Practices**
   - Maintain professional, supportive tone
   - Focus on observable behaviors
   - Consider environmental factors
   - Prioritize student privacy

4. **Safety & Privacy**
   - No clinical diagnoses
   - No medical recommendations
   - Data security focused
   - FERPA/HIPAA aware responses

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `server/groq.ts` - Groq API integration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

**Modified:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Added chat endpoints
- `client/src/pages/chat.tsx` - Integrated real API calls
- `package.json` - Will need groq-sdk dependency

### Environment Variables Required

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_api_key_here
```

Get your API key from: https://console.groq.com/keys

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Groq SDK**
   ```bash
   npm install groq-sdk
   ```

2. **Set up Groq API Key**
   - Visit https://console.groq.com/keys

     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
     ```

3. **Restart the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Testing Steps

1. **Login** to the application
2. **Navigate** to the Chat/Record Incident page
3. **Select a student** from the dropdown
4. **Type a message** describing an incident:
   ```
   Emma got upset during math class and threw her pencil across the room.
   ```
5. **Verify**: AI responds with a clarifying question
6. **Continue conversation** by answering questions
7. **Click "Generate ABC Form"** when conversation is complete
8. **Verify**: Form is populated with extracted data:
   - Summary is concise
   - Antecedent describes what happened before
   - Behavior is objective and specific
   - Consequence describes what happened after
   - Incident type is categorized correctly
   - Function of behavior is suggested

### Error Handling

The integration includes robust error handling:

**Rate Limiting (429)**
- Message: "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait a moment and try again."
- Groq free tier: 30 requests/minute

**Authentication (401)**
- Message: "API authentication failed. Please check your Groq API key."
- Check `.env` file has correct `GROQ_API_KEY`

**General Errors**
- Graceful fallback messages
- Conversation context preserved
- User can retry without losing data

### Performance Considerations

- **Model**: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` - Fast responses (~1-2 seconds)
- **Token Limits**: Max 1024 tokens per response
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for chat, 0.3 for extraction (more consistent)
- **Streaming**: Disabled for simpler implementation (can be enabled later)

## Troubleshooting

### Student Detail Page Issues

**Problem**: Student detail page shows "Student not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure student ID in URL matches database ID
- **Check**: Browser console for API errors
- **Verify**: Student exists in database: `SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = X;`

**Problem**: Incidents not showing
- **Solution**: Check incidents are associated with correct student_id
- **Verify**: `SELECT * FROM incidents WHERE student_id = X;`

**Problem**: Charts show no data
- **Solution**: Add incidents with proper date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Check**: Incident dates are within last 14 days for trend chart

### Chatbot Issues

**Problem**: "Cannot find module 'groq-sdk'"
- **Solution**: Run `npm install groq-sdk`
- **Verify**: Check `package.json` includes groq-sdk

**Problem**: "API authentication failed"
- **Solution**: Check `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- **Verify**: Key starts with `gsk_`
- **Test**: Visit https://console.groq.com/keys to verify key is active

**Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded"
- **Solution**: Wait 60 seconds before retrying
- **Consider**: Upgrade to Groq paid tier for higher limits
- **Monitor**: Check usage at https://console.groq.com/usage

**Problem**: AI responses are slow
- **Solution**: This is normal (1-3 seconds per response)
- **Check**: Network connection
- **Consider**: Switch to faster model if needed (e.g., llama-3.1-8b-instant)

**Problem**: ABC extraction returns empty fields
- **Solution**: Ensure conversation has enough detail
- **Improve**: Ask more specific questions during chat
- **Verify**: At least 3-4 message exchanges before extraction
