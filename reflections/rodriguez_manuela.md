## Summary
FERPA is a U.S. federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. It grants parents (and students once they turn 18 or attend postsecondary education) rights to access, review, and request corrections to these records. Schools generally must obtain written consent before disclosing personally identifiable information, although certain exceptions apply (e.g., disclosures to school officials with legitimate educational interest or in health/safety emergencies). FERPA also gives parents and students the right to control disclosure to third parties, and institutions that fail to comply may lose federal funding. The law is designed to balance educational accountability with strong protections for student privacy.

## Insights Learned
1. Education records are broadly defined: incident logs, summaries, or AI-generated reports could all count as “education records” if stored by a school.  
2. Consent is not always required: teachers, administrators, and specialists may access records without consent if they have a “legitimate educational interest.”  
3. Parents/students can request corrections: any AI-generated summaries or tags must be editable or challengeable to comply with rights of review and amendment.  

## Limitations / Risks
1. Ambiguity in definitions: distinguishing between “personal notes” and official “education records” can be unclear, which creates compliance risks.  
2. Administrative burden: ensuring proper consent management, access logging, and correction workflows could complicate adoption for teachers and schools.  

## Idea for the Project
Add a **FERPA Compliance Layer**: integrate role-based access (only authorized school officials see full details), audit logs for record access, and a parent/student portal where they can review, request edits, or consent to data sharing. This ensures the tool respects FERPA while still making documentation easy for teachers.
