## Summary
FERPA is a U.S. federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. It grants parents (and students once they turn 18 or attend postsecondary education) rights to access, review, and request corrections to these records. Schools generally must obtain written consent before disclosing personally identifiable information, although certain exceptions apply (e.g., disclosures to school officials with legitimate educational interest or in health/safety emergencies). FERPA also gives parents and students the right to control disclosure to third parties, and institutions that fail to comply may lose federal funding. The law is designed to balance educational accountability with strong protections for student privacy.

## Insights Learned
1. Education records are broadly defined: incident logs, summaries, or AI-generated reports could all count as “education records” if stored by a school.  
2. Consent is not always required: teachers, administrators, and specialists may access records without consent if they have a “legitimate educational interest.”  
3. Parents/students can request corrections: any AI-generated summaries or tags must be editable or challengeable to comply with rights of review and amendment.  

## Limitations / Risks
1. Ambiguity in definitions: distinguishing between “personal notes” and official “education records” can be unclear, which creates compliance risks.  
2. Administrative burden: ensuring proper consent management, access logging, and correction workflows could complicate adoption for teachers and schools.  

## Idea for the Project
Add a **FERPA Compliance Layer**: integrate role-based access (only authorized school officials see full details), audit logs for record access, and a parent/student portal where they can review, request edits, or consent to data sharing. This ensures the tool respects FERPA while still making documentation easy for teachers.

# Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence in Education — Literature Review
Nguyen, A., Ngo, H. N., Hong, Y., Dang, B., & Nguyen, B.-P. T. (2023). Ethical principles for artificial intelligence in education. *Education and Information Technologies, 28*(4221–4241). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11316-w

## Summary
This paper examines the global debate on what constitutes ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence in education (AIED). The authors conduct a thematic analysis of key international guidelines, including those from UNESCO, the OECD, and the European Commission, to synthesize areas of overlap and divergence. From this analysis, they identify seven guiding principles: governance and stewardship, transparency and accountability, sustainability and proportionality, privacy, security and safety, inclusiveness, and human-centered AIED. Each principle is discussed with implications for teachers, students, developers, and policymakers. The authors conclude that while these principles provide a necessary foundation, they remain broad and require further contextualization and implementation research in educational settings.

## Insights
1. The paper highlights that ethical design in AIED cannot be reduced to technical safeguards it has to explicitly embed human rights, inclusiveness, and learner agency at its core.  
2. Transparency is treated as more than just algorithmic explainability it also includes clarity about data ownership, purposes of data use, and the openness of regulatory processes.  
3. The authors emphasize that sustainability is not just environmental but also social and economic, urging developers and policymakers to anticipate long-term effects on labor markets, culture, and equity in education.

## Limitations / Risks
1. The principles, while comprehensive, are intentionally high-level and do not provide actionable guidance for day-to-day implementation in classrooms, leaving interpretation to institutions and developers.  
2. Because the framework is synthesized from international policy documents, it risks being too generic, and may overlook localized educational contexts. Which is why we must also look at local policies surrounding AI use in education.

## Idea for the Project
Ensure that the Autism Support AI tool incorporates **human-centered oversight** by allowing teachers to remain in control of how incident summaries and tags are stored, shared, and interpreted. In practice, this could mean that AI-generated summaries are always reviewable and editable by the teacher before becoming part of the official student record, aligning with the principles of accountability & transparency.
