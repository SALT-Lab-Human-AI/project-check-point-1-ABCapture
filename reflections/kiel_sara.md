### Summary
Antecedent Behavior Consequence Data (ABC Data) is a strategy for assessing human behavior and is commonly used when working with individuals with autism. It involves "directly observing and recording factors surrounding a target behavior for the purpose of analyzing patterns and hypothesizing a possible function maintaining the behavior" (Nebraska Autism Spectrum Disorders Network, 2018). The goal is to find common triggers of undesired behaviors and understand why they may be happening.

This resource posted by Nebraska Autism Spectrum Disorders Network results from a literature review and outlines how and when to use the ABC Data collection process. It also provides several data sheet templates, examples, and other resource links that may be beneficial.

### Insights Learned
- The process emphasizes clear operational definitions of behaviors and requires consistency among multiple observers for reliability.
- Collecting antecedent and consequent conditions around behaviors allows educators and caregivers to hypothesize the function behind behaviors.
- The data can be collected narratively or through checklist formats, providing flexibility depending on observer experience and setting.
- Incorporating setting events and environment influences extends the understanding of behavior beyond immediate triggers.

### Limitations/Risks
- Data collection can be time-consuming and may require training to ensure consistent, accurate, and unbiased observations across different observers.
- Privacy and ethical concerns arise with detailed observation and documentation of behaviors, especially regarding sensitive or stigmatizing information.
- Overemphasis on behavior tracking might lead to an overly clinical approach, missing holistic understanding of the individual's needs and context.

### How This Inspires Our Project
When focusing on the incident logging portion of our project, it will be important to use commonly practiced incident logging/response strategies already being used by experts. We can thus ensure that the incident logging AI-powered tool is using the ABC Data process as part of its framework.

## Teachers and educators’ experiences and perceptions of artificial-powered interventions for autism groups - Reflection

### Summary
This qualitative study investigates the perceptions and experiences of 20 educators and parents regarding AI-powered interventions for children with autism. Using semi-structured interviews and focus groups, the research identified perceived benefits such as increased engagement, personalized learning, and real-time feedback. Challenges included limited access to technology, the need for educator training, potential bias in AI systems, ethical concerns, and the risk of overreliance on technology replacing human interaction. The study emphasizes the importance of cultural and linguistic appropriateness, avoiding bias, and collaborative design involving families and communities to enhance intervention effectiveness and inclusivity.

### Insights Learned
- Individualized approaches are crucial since each child with autism presents unique strengths and challenges, making one-size-fits-all solutions ineffective.
- Effective implementation depends heavily on educator training, technical support, and culturally responsive design to maximize benefits across diverse populations.
- Real-time feedback benefits both children and educators by reinforcing positive behaviors and enabling tailored instructional adjustments.
- Collaborative involvement of families and communities enhances cultural sensitivity, relevance, and overall impact of AI interventions.
- Regular audits and ongoing research are necessary to address biases, ensure ethical standards, and evaluate long-term efficacy and accessibility.

### Limitations/Risks
- Findings from this study may not generalize widely due to a limited, demographically specific sample (Iranian educators and parents).
- Overreliance on AI technology risks reducing critical human social interactions essential for emotional and social development.

### How This Inspires Our Project
This study highlights the importance of embedding personalized, culturally sensitive, and ethically responsible AI frameworks in educational interventions for children with autism. For our project, it underscores the need to prioritize real-time feedback, user training, and inclusive design when building AI-powered tools like incident loggers and document organizers. We will want to ensure our solution is both effective in supporting autistic learners and practical for educators.
