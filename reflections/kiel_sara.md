### Summary
Antecedent Behavior Consequence Data (ABC Data) is a strategy for assessing human behavior and is commonly used when working with individuals with autism. It involves "directly observing and recording factors surrounding a target behavior for the purpose of analyzing patterns and hypothesizing a possible function maintaining the behavior" (Nebraska Autism Spectrum Disorders Network, 2018). The goal is to find common triggers of undesired behaviors and understand why they may be happening.

This resource posted by Nebraska Autism Spectrum Disorders Network results from a literature review and outlines how and when to use the ABC Data collection process. It also provides several data sheet templates, examples, and other resource links that may be beneficial.

### Insights Learned
- The process emphasizes clear operational definitions of behaviors and requires consistency among multiple observers for reliability.
- Collecting antecedent and consequent conditions around behaviors allows educators and caregivers to hypothesize the function behind behaviors.
- The data can be collected narratively or through checklist formats, providing flexibility depending on observer experience and setting.
- Incorporating setting events and environment influences extends the understanding of behavior beyond immediate triggers.

### Limitations/Risks
- Data collection can be time-consuming and may require training to ensure consistent, accurate, and unbiased observations across different observers.
- Privacy and ethical concerns arise with detailed observation and documentation of behaviors, especially regarding sensitive or stigmatizing information.
- Overemphasis on behavior tracking might lead to an overly clinical approach, missing holistic understanding of the individual's needs and context.

### How This Inspires Our Project
When focusing on the incident logging portion of our project, it will be important to use commonly practiced incident logging/response strategies already being used by experts. We can thus ensure that the incident logging AI-powered tool is using the ABC Data process as part of its framework.
