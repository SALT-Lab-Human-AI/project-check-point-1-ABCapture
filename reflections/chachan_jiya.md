## Breaking Barriers—The Intersection of AI and Assistive Technology in Autism Care: A Narrative Review

Iannone, A., & Giansanti, D. (2024). Breaking Barriers—The Intersection of AI and Assistive Technology in Autism Care: A Narrative Review. Journal of Personalized Medicine, 14(1), 41. https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm14010041


This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into assistive technologies (AT) for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors analyzed 22 studies, including reviews and research on AI-driven tools like smart glasses, robots, and mobile apps. Findings show that AI can enhance communication, emotion recognition, and social engagement, while also offering opportunities for personalization and adaptive learning. The field is still in an early stage, with more focus on innovation than on healthcare integration or regulation. Ethical and practical issues, such as privacy and user acceptance, remain major challenges. Overall, the review highlights AI’s strong potential to improve autism support but calls for more balanced research and real-world adoption.

#### 3 Insights Learned

1. AI-driven robots and wearable devices (like smart glasses) are being tested to help autistic children with communication and social skills.
2. Personalization is a recurring theme - AI can adapt tools to individual needs, which is crucial given the wide variation within the autism spectrum.
3. Research is expanding quickly, but there’s still a lack of focus on regulation, ethics, and long-term usability in schools or healthcare.

#### 2 Limitations/Risks

1. The diversity of autism makes it difficult to design one-size-fits-all AI solutions, which risks leaving some individuals unsupported.
2. Privacy and data security are significant concerns because many AI tools rely on sensitive personal or behavioral data.

#### 1 Idea for Our Project

This paper inspired the idea that our **voice-to-text incident logger with auto-summary** could also learn over time, personalizing summaries and tags based on the teacher’s past inputs and the specific needs of each student, making it more adaptive and useful.

## Educators’ Challenges of Including Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Mainstream Classrooms

Lindsay, S., Proulx, M., Thomson, N., & Scott, H. (2013). Educators’ Challenges of Including Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Mainstream Classrooms. International Journal of Disability, Development & Education, 60(4), 347–362. https://doi-org.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/10.1080/1034912X.2013.846470

This qualitative study examined the experiences of 13 educators in Ontario, Canada, who had taught children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mainstream classrooms. Through in-depth interviews, the authors found that teachers faced three main challenges: understanding and managing behavior, socio-structural barriers (such as lack of training, resources, and policy support), and creating inclusive classroom environments. Teachers often reported feeling unprepared to handle meltdowns, unstructured time, or behavioral differences while also meeting the needs of the rest of the class. They also noted limited access to resources like educational assistants, specialized training, or adaptive materials. Finally, educators described difficulties with parental engagement and peer acceptance, which made inclusion harder. Overall, the study highlights systemic and personal challenges teachers encounter when supporting children with ASD.

#### 3 Insights Learned

1. Teachers often receive little to no training specific to autism, leaving them unprepared for behavioral challenges.
2. Socio-structural barriers, such as limited funding for resources and assistants, heavily impact successful inclusion.
3. Inclusion depends not just on the teacher but also on broader community support, including parents, peers, and other school staff.

#### 2 Limitations/Risks

1. The sample size is small (13 teachers in Ontario), so findings may not generalize to all regions or contexts.
2. Many participants already had special education training, which may not reflect the experiences of general classroom teachers elsewhere.

#### 1 Idea for Our Project

This paper highlights how teachers struggle to capture and manage behavioral incidents in real-time, suggesting that our voice-to-text incident logger with auto-summary could directly reduce the stress of documenting behaviors while also providing a consistent record that helps teachers, parents, and specialists collaborate more effectively.
