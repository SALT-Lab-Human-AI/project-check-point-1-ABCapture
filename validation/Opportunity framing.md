# Opportunity Framing â€“ Notebook LM

The findings from the NotebookLM validation study highlight several opportunities for ABCapture to address gaps that existing tools do not cover.  

1. **Real-time voice input:** ABCapture should allow teachers to record incidents hands-free during class, enabling faster and more natural data capture.  
2. **Automatic tagging and organization:** The tool should automatically detect and label key information such as student name, behavior type, and resolution without requiring manual prompting.  
3. **Context-aware summaries:** Summaries should capture emotional tone and behavioral context in language that fits real classroom communication.  
4. **Privacy and compliance:** Built-in data protection that aligns with FERPA and school privacy policies is essential to ensure teacher and parent trust.  
5. **Low latency and seamless UX:** Teachers should be able to log, summarize, and save incidents quickly with minimal steps.  
6. **Teacher-centered design:** The interface should align with classroom realities - simple and focused on saving time and reducing administrative stress.
