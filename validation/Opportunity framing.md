# Opportunity Framing


## Purpose  
This document summarizes the **specific product opportunities and requirements** that ABCapture should meet.
It highlights the **unique gaps** not currently addressed by existing tools and translates them into **product-level requirements** for ABCapture’s next development phase.

---

## Key Insights From Validation  
Across tools, we found strong performance in:
- **Speech-to-Text Accuracy** (when available)
- **Clear, concise summaries**
- **Basic ABC (Antecedent–Behavior–Consequence) extraction**
- **Basic tagging (student, date, incident type)**  

However, we identified **systemic limitations** that prevent these tools from being truly usable in classroom contexts.

---

## Major Gaps Identified

### 1. Lack of Real-Time, Hands-Free Workflow  
**Problem:** Existing tools require multiple steps (uploading audio, prompting for summaries, organizing results).  
**Impact:** Teachers cannot use these tools during live classroom moments without interrupting instruction.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Enable **instant, one-tap voice capture** and automatic summarization.  
- Support **continuous or interrupted dictation** without manual uploads.  
- Reduce teacher cognitive load by removing extra prompts and formatting steps.

---

### 2. Poor Handling of Overlapping or Multi-Student Incidents  
**Problem:** No tool could automatically separate or attribute behaviors when multiple students were involved.  
**Impact:** Teachers must manually edit or re-enter incident notes, creating inconsistent data.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Integrate **AI logic to detect and split distinct incidents** or **assign actions to multiple students** from a single transcript.  
- Auto-suggest tags for each individual and allow easy correction.

---

### 3. Limited Emotional & Contextual Understanding  
**Problem:** Summaries were often overly formal and lacked emotional nuance or tone that could inform behavior analysis.  
**Impact:** Critical social and emotional context is lost, making reports less actionable for specialists.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Train summarization prompts/models to **preserve affective cues** (e.g., tone, intensity, emotional triggers).  
- Provide **optional “context emphasis” summaries** that include tone and setting without bias.

---

### 4. Incomplete Tagging and Metadata Automation  
**Problem:** Most systems required manual prompting or editing to create tags; few captured date/time automatically.  
**Impact:** Teachers lose time and consistency in data organization.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Implement **automatic metadata capture** (date, time, student, type, severity).  
- Use **context-aware tagging** for behavior categories, emotional tone, and environmental triggers.  
- Enable **searchable, multi-layer tagging** for longitudinal pattern analysis.

---

### 5. Fragmented Workflows Across Tools  
**Problem:** Even strong AI models (e.g., NotebookLM, Notion AI) required jumping between transcription, summary, and tagging interfaces.  
**Impact:** Disjointed workflows discourage consistent documentation.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Build a **unified interface** integrating all core functions: voice logging → summary → tagging → search.  
- Design for **speed and simplicity**, optimized for mobile or tablet use in real classrooms.

---

### 6. Unclear Data Privacy and FERPA Compliance  
**Problem:** All evaluated tools rely on commercial cloud storage (e.g., Google, Notion) without explicit FERPA compliance.  
**Impact:** Schools cannot safely store sensitive student data using these systems.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Prioritize **local or institution-controlled data storage**.  
- Provide **transparent privacy settings** and **automatic anonymization** of personally identifiable information (PII).  
- Include **clear data export and deletion policies** aligned with educational regulations.

---

### 7. Limited Adaptability to Messy or Noisy Inputs  
**Problem:** Few systems effectively handled background noise, disfluencies, or fragmented speech typical of classroom recordings.  
**Impact:** Teachers must clean data manually or re-record incidents.  
**Opportunity:**  
- Integrate **noise-robust speech recognition** tuned for multi-speaker, real-world classroom environments.  
- Apply **error correction** and **contextual recovery** to improve transcription quality in live conditions.

## Summary: Product Requirements for ABCapture  

| **Need** | **Design Requirement** | **Why It Matters** |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Hands-Free Real-Time Capture** | Voice-to-text logging activated by a single button, immediate summary generation | Enables in-the-moment use without disrupting teaching |
| **Incident Segmentation** | AI distinguishes multiple students/incidents in a single recording | Increases accuracy and reduces rework |
| **Emotionally Aware Summaries** | Summaries include tone and context while staying objective | Provides richer data for behavior analysis |
| **Smart Auto-Tagging** | Auto-tags student, date/time, behavior type, severity | Saves time and standardizes reports |
| **Unified Workflow** | Seamless flow from recording to review in one interface | Encourages consistent daily use |
| **Privacy & Compliance** | Local storage, anonymization, FERPA-aligned policies | Ensures safe use in educational settings |
| **Noise Robustness** | Enhanced speech recognition for real classrooms | Improves reliability in real-world conditions |

## Framing Statement  

**Opportunity:**  
No existing tool provides a **privacy-safe, hands-free, emotionally intelligent, and unified system** for capturing, summarizing, and organizing behavioral incidents in autism-support classrooms.  

**ABCapture** will fill this gap by delivering **real-time AI assistance** that mirrors teachers’ natural workflows — allowing them to document incidents instantly, preserve context, and communicate clearly with minimal administrative burden.
