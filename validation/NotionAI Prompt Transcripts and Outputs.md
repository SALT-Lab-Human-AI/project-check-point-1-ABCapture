## **1.1 Transcript**

So, for the ABC form, the student is Alex Brown. The incident happened at 10.15am on October 3rd, 2025\. The duration of this observation is around 30 minutes. The staff that observed this behavior was me, Valerie Frizzle, and it took place It was during our small math group at the back table where I was working with four other students at the time. And for the antecedent...

A few students were talking loudly and I reminded the group to stay focused. Then Alex started tapping his pencil and humming while I was giving directions. For the behavior, after I asked him to stop, he said the noise was bothering him and pushed his worksheet off the table. For the consequence, I directed him to take a 5 minute break in the calm corner. When he came back, he finished his math problems without any issues.

So overall, I think the function was partly sensory, the noise, and partly escape, since the break really helped calm me.

## **2.1 Transcript**

This morning during our math small group, Alex began tapping his pencil and humming while I was giving instructions. And just before that, a few other students were talking loudly, and I reminded the group to stay focused. When I asked Alex to stop tapping,

He said the noise from the others was bothering him and pushed his worksheet off the table. I directed him to the calm corner for a five minute break, and when he came back, he completed his math problems without any further issues.

## **2.2 Generated Summary** 

### **Incident Summary**

* Alex exhibited disruptive behavior (tapping pencil and humming) during math small group instruction.  
* Other students were talking loudly before this incident, which Alex later identified as bothersome.  
* When asked to stop tapping, Alex pushed worksheet off the table in frustration.  
* Teacher directed Alex to the "calm corner" for a five-minute break.  
* After the break, Alex successfully completed math problems without further issues.

### **Environmental Factors**

* Classroom noise from other students appeared to be a trigger for Alex's behavior.  
* Alex verbally expressed that the noise from others was bothering them.

### **Intervention and Outcome**

* The "calm corner" break strategy was effective in this situation.  
* The brief 5-minute break helped Alex reset and return to work successfully.  
* Alex was able to complete the assigned math problems after the intervention.

### **Action Items**

* \[ \] Consider monitoring Alex for potential sensory sensitivities to noise.  
* \[ \] Evaluate classroom noise management strategies during small group work.  
* \[ \] Continue using the "calm corner" strategy as it proved effective in this situation.

## **2.3a Form Completion Prompt**

##  Fill out the ABC form from the information provided from my audio. Use objective language. If any information required by the form is not mentioned by me in the recording please let me know so we can fill out correctly.

## **2.3b Agent Response**

I filled in the ABC form on your page using objective language from your audio. I also summarized antecedents, behaviors, consequences, and what was effective.

To complete the form accurately, I still need a few details:

* Exact time of day for the observation  
* Duration of the observation window  
* Clarification on setting if needed beyond “classroom, small group instruction” (e.g., table area, group size)  
* Any injuries, safety concerns, or property damage beyond the worksheet being pushed off the table  
* Whether any additional staff or peers intervened besides your direction to the calm corner  
* Your intent on hypothesized function at this time (sensory/automatic vs. attention vs. escape). From the recording, “noise bothering Alex” suggests a possible sensory component, but I left function as “not determined” pending your confirmation.

Quick recap of what I entered:

* Student: Alex  
* Date: 2025-10-07  
* Time of Day: Math small group instruction (exact time pending)  
* Setting: Classroom, small group instruction  
* Antecedents: Loud peer talk, teacher giving instructions, request to stop tapping  
* Behavior: Tapping and humming; pushed worksheet off table; reported noise was bothersome  
* Consequences: Directed to calm corner for 5 minutes; returned and completed work  
* Notes (effective response): Calm corner break was effective

Share the missing items, and I’ll update the form right away.

Well, this morning during math group was just great. I have to log an incident report for it. Okay, this was with Alex Brown, and it happened this morning at about 10.15, October 3rd, 2025\. The whole thing lasted maybe 30 minutes and I'm Valerie Frizzle and it was during our math small group at the back table in my classroom where I was working with four students.

So, I had just reminded everyone to stay focused because a few kids were talking way too loudly, and this is when Alex decided it would be the perfect time to start his own little percussion concert, just tapping his pencil and humming right in the middle of my direction.

When I asked him to stop, he said the noise was bothering him which sure like makes sense since he was adding to it and he pushed his worksheet off the table like it had done something to him. I told him to take 5 minutes in the calm corner to cool off, and surprise, that fixed everything. He came back calm as can be and finished his math problems like nothing had ever happened. Honestly, I don't know what to say.

I'd say it was partly sensory, with the noise, and partly just escape since the quick break seemed to reset him completely.

I'm Jordan Smith and Alex Brown, and it happened today during indoor recess at around 1.30 in the afternoon, October 3rd, 2025\. I'm Ms. Valerie Frizzle, and it lasted maybe 10 minutes or so in my classroom play area where the building blocks are set up.

I didn't actually see how it started. When I looked over, Jordan was saying Alex took the blocks from him and Alex was insisting he had them first. They were both getting louder, talking over each other, and then Jordan knocked over what Alex had built.

Alex yelled and pushed the blocks off the table. I stepped in right away and had them take breaks on opposites. sides of the room. After a few minutes, they both calmed down, apologized, and helped clean up. Honestly, I'm not sure who started it. It might have been about taking turns or sharing, but it escalated pretty quickly once they got

## **5.2 Transcript**

This report is for Alex Brown, and it took place today, October 3rd, 2025\. I'm Ms. Valerie Frizzle, and both incidents happened in my classroom. The first one was around 10.15 during math small group. It lasted maybe 10 minutes. The second one was later in the day, right before dismissal, about 2.45.

So for the first one, Alex was at the back of the table working on math problems when a couple of other students were chatting loudly. I reminded everyone to focus and Alex started tapping his pencil and humming. When I asked him to stop, he said the noise was too much and pushed his worksheet off the table. I had him take a short break in the calm corner and when he came back, he finished his work without any issues.

Then later in the afternoon, during clean-up time, Alex got frustrated because another student moved his backpack. He started yelling that people were judging his stuff and refused to line up. I asked him to take a few deep breaths, but he kept arguing, so I had him wait by the door with me until the rest of the class was ready.

Once things settled, he apologized and walked out calmly. Both times, it seemed like the noise and unexpected changes set him off, but once he got space and started.

## **6.1 Transcript**

Okay, so for the ABC form, the student is Alex Brown. The incident happened at 1015 on October 3rd, 2025\. Please quiet down. The duration of this observation is around 30 minutes. The staff that observed this behavior was me, Valerie Frizzle, and the setting where the observation occurred was in my classroom.

It was during our math small group at the back table where I was working with four students at the time. For the antecedent, a few students were talking loudly and I reminded the group to stay focused. Then Alex started tapping his pencil and humming while I was giving directions.

After I asked him to stop, he said the noise was bothering him. and pushed his worksheet off the table. As a consequence, I directed him to take a five-minute break in the calm corner. When he came back, he finished his math problems without any issues. So overall, I think the function was partly sensory due to the noise and partly escape since the break helped him calm down.
