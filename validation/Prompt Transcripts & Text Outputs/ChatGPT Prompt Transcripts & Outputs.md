# Prompt Transcripts & Outputs

### Tool: ChatGPT Agent
### Agent setup prompt:
> You are a behavior incident logging assistant designed to help educators document classroom incidents objectively and efficiently. Each test will include one or more classroom event descriptions. For each input: Transcribe (if audio) or clean the text. Summarize in 2–3 sentences using professional, neutral language. Identify ABC elements: Antecedent (what happened before) Behavior (what the student did) Consequence (how staff responded) Tag each incident with: Student name Behavior type (disruption, defiance, peer conflict, etc.) Resolution/outcome Ask for missing info (date, time, observer, injuries, etc.) before logging. Create an ABC form entry in structured text with all completed fields. Add the incident to a tracker table with columns: Incident ID | Student | Date | Time | Setting | ABC Status | Safety | Resolution | Link to Notes

### Scenario 1 — Student Frustration During Reading Group

### Input (Voice Note)
> During a reading group, Ella grew upset when she couldn’t find a page in the book. She sighed loudly, closed her book hard, and said she didn’t want to read anymore. The teacher reminded her that she could take a short break and rejoin when ready. After two minutes, Ella came back and read quietly within the group.

---

**Prompt 1:** “Summarize the event in 2–3 sentences for the behavior log.”  
**Output:**  
> During a reading group, Ella became frustrated when she couldn’t find the correct page in her book. She expressed this frustration by sighing loudly, closing her book forcefully and stating she did not want to continue reading. After the teacher offered her a brief break, she rejoined the group after two minutes and read quietly.

**Prompt 2:** “Identify the antecedent, behavior, and consequence.”  
**Output:**  
> - **Antecedent (A):** Ella was participating in a reading group and could not locate the correct page in her book.  
> - **Behavior (B):** She sighed loudly, closed her book with force and said she didn’t want to read anymore.  
> - **Consequence (C):** The teacher offered her a short break, and after two minutes she returned to the group and read quietly.

**Prompt 3:** “Tag each incident with student name, behavior type, and resolution.”  
**Output:**  
> - **Student Name:** Ella  
> - **Behavior Type:** Task refusal / Defiance (expressed reluctance to continue reading)  
> - **Resolution:** Took a brief break and then rejoined the reading group calmly.

**Prompt 4:** “Ask for missing info before logging.”  
**Output:**  
> The assistant requested the date, time, setting, observer and confirmation of any injuries. The teacher later provided that the incident occurred on 6 Oct 2026 at 2 PM in Classroom 45 with no injuries.

### Reflection
ChatGPT captured the key details of this single‑student incident and maintained a neutral, professional tone. It accurately separated the antecedent, behavior and consequence, and generated appropriate tags. Importantly, it asked for missing information (date, time, setting, injuries) before finalizing the log, which matches best practices for objective behavior documentation. Once the teacher supplied the missing details, the assistant completed the structured ABC entry without introducing extra conjecture.

### Scenario 2 — Two Students’ Dispute During Art Time

### Input
> During art time, Noah and Priya argued about who would use the blue paint. Noah said he had it first, and Priya raised her voice saying he always takes too long. Noah called her “bossy,” and Priya threw the brush on the table. The aide stepped in, separated them, and helped them take turns.

---

**Prompt 1:** “Summarize the event in 2–3 sentences for the behavior log.”  
**Output:**  
> During art time, Noah and Priya argued over who would use the blue paint. Noah insisted he had it first and called Priya “bossy,” while Priya raised her voice saying he always takes too long and threw the brush on the table. The aide separated them and guided them to take turns with the paint.

**Prompt 2:** “List each student’s behavior separately.”  
**Output:**  
> **Noah’s Behavior:**  
> - Argued that he had the paint first.  
> - Called Priya “bossy.”  
>  
> **Priya’s Behavior:**  
> - Raised her voice and complained that Noah takes too long.  
> - Threw the paintbrush onto the table.

**Prompt 3:** “Generate tags by student name and behavior type.”  
**Output:**  
> | **Student Name** | **Behavior Type Tags** |  
> |------------------|------------------------|  
> | **Noah** | Peer conflict; verbal aggression; name‑calling |  
> | **Priya** | Peer conflict; verbal aggression; object throwing/aggressive gesture |

**Prompt 4:** “Create separate ABC entries for each student.”  
**Output:**  
> **Noah**  
> - **Antecedent:** Noah and a peer both wanted to use the blue paint during art time.  
> - **Behavior:** He argued that he had it first and called Priya “bossy.”  
> - **Consequence:** The aide intervened, separated the students and guided them to take turns.  
> - **Behavior Type:** Peer conflict; verbal aggression  
> - **Resolution:** After intervention, Noah took turns using the paint and the activity continued calmly.  
>  
> **Priya**  
> - **Antecedent:** Priya wanted to use the blue paint while another student was still using it.  
> - **Behavior:** She raised her voice, complained that Noah always takes too long and threw the brush on the table.  
> - **Consequence:** The aide stepped in, separated the students and facilitated turn‑taking.  
> - **Behavior Type:** Peer conflict; object throwing  
> - **Resolution:** She took turns with the paint and resumed the activity.

After the prompts, the teacher provided additional details: the incident occurred on 9 Oct 2025 at 10:00 AM in Classroom 45, and no injuries were reported.

### Reflection
ChatGPT handled this multi‑student conflict by clearly delineating each student’s behavior and outcome. The summary captured both actions without assigning blame and maintained a neutral tone. By generating tags and separate ABC entries, it organized the incident for easier logging. Once the teacher supplied the time, date and setting, the assistant produced a structured log for each student. Future improvements could include prompting for observer names to complete the record.

###  Scenario 3 — Messy Voice‑to‑Text Note About a Personal Item

### Input
> Uh yeah, so… this morning, Ben just like got mad again when someone moved his water bottle. He shouted, “Stop touching my stuff!” and pushed his chair back. I told him to cool off by the window and he sat there for a bit. Then he came back and worked fine.

---

**Prompt 1:** “Clean and summarize what happened.”  
**Output:**  
> During a morning activity, Ben became upset after someone moved his water bottle. He shouted, “Stop touching my stuff!” and pushed his chair back. The teacher directed him to take a brief break by the window, after which he returned and resumed his work calmly.

**Prompt 2:** “Identify what triggered the behavior and how the teacher responded.”  
**Output:**  
> - **Trigger (Antecedent):** Someone moved Ben’s water bottle, causing him to feel that his belongings were being disturbed.  
> - **Teacher Response (Consequence):** The teacher told Ben to cool off by the window; he sat there for a few minutes before returning to class and working as expected.

**Prompt 3:** “List missing details that would help complete the ABC record.”  
**Output:**  
> To complete the ABC log, the assistant noted that it would be helpful to have the exact date and time, the specific setting (e.g., classroom number or area), the name of the observer, and confirmation of any injuries or safety concerns.

### Reflection
The model effectively cleaned up the informal, spoken‑style note and produced a concise, neutral summary. It correctly identified the trigger (a moved water bottle) and the teacher’s response (providing a cooling‑off period). It also highlighted the missing data needed for a complete record. The assistant could not finalize an ABC entry without the date, time and setting, so it prompted for those details, which aligns with good data‑collection practice.

### Scenario 4 — Two Incidents With the Same Student

### Input
> Incident 1 (~9:30 AM): Group math → Liam tapping pencil loudly → asked to stop → threw pencil → calm corner → returned and finished worksheet.  
> Incident 2 (~2:20 PM): Recess → ball taken by another student → Liam yelled, refused to play → sat alone for five minutes → rejoined after teacher check‑in.

---

**Prompt 1:** “Split into two incidents and summarize each.”  
**Output:**  
> **Incident 1:** During a group math activity around 9:30 AM, Liam was tapping his pencil loudly. When asked to stop, he threw the pencil. The teacher directed him to the calm corner; after a brief break he returned and completed his worksheet.  
>  
> **Incident 2:** Around 2:20 PM at recess, another student took the ball Liam was using. Liam yelled and refused to continue playing. The teacher had him sit alone for five minutes and checked in with him, after which he rejoined the game.

**Prompt 2:** “Create two separate ABC forms with provisional function (Sensory + Escape).”  
**Output:**  
> **Incident 1 – Liam (INC0004):**  
> - **Antecedent:** Group math session where he was tapping his pencil.  
> - **Behavior:** Threw his pencil when asked to stop tapping.  
> - **Consequence:** Directed to the calm corner for a short break; returned and finished his work.  
> - **Behavior Type:** Disruption / defiance  
> - **Provisional Function:** Sensory (self‑stimulation) + Escape (avoidance of redirection)  
> - **Outcome:** Completed his worksheet after the break.  
>  
> **Incident 2 – Liam (INC0005):**  
> - **Antecedent:** Another student took the ball he was using during recess.  
> - **Behavior:** Yelled and refused to play.  
> - **Consequence:** Sat alone for five minutes and received a teacher check‑in; then rejoined play.  
> - **Behavior Type:** Peer conflict / refusal  
> - **Provisional Function:** Escape (avoidance of conflict) + Sensory (upset over item removal)  
> - **Outcome:** Returned to the game after calming down.

**Prompt 3:** “Add both to tracker and list common triggers and successful responses.”  
**Output:**  
> **Tracker Entries:**  
> | Incident ID | Student | Date | Time | Setting | ABC Status | Safety | Resolution | Link to Notes |  
> |-------------|---------|------|------|---------|------------|--------|------------|---------------|  
> | INC0004 | Liam | *[Date not provided]* | ~09:30 | Classroom – math group | Complete | No injuries | Calm corner break, then completed worksheet | See ABC form above |  
> | INC0005 | Liam | *[Date not provided]* | ~14:20 | Playground – recess | Complete | No injuries | Brief time alone, then rejoined play | See ABC form above |  
>  
> **Common Triggers:** Difficulty stopping self‑stimulating behavior (pencil tapping) and feeling that a peer has taken his equipment (ball).  
>  
> **Successful Responses:** Providing Liam with a short, structured break (calm corner or sitting alone) followed by a teacher check‑in allowed him to regulate his emotions and return to the activity.

### Reflection
ChatGPT divided a compound note into two distinct incidents and provided clear summaries. The ABC forms included provisional functions (Sensory + Escape), which offer hypotheses about why the behaviors occurred. The tracker entries were organized with provisional dates and times; however, the assistant noted that the exact date and observer information were still needed. The synthesis of common triggers and effective responses across the two incidents provides useful insight for future interventions.
