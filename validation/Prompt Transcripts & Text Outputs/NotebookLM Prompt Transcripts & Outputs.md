# Prompt Transcripts & Outputs

### Tool: NotebookLM  

### 🧩 Scenario 1 — Typical Case: Simple Classroom Conflict  

### Input (Teacher Note)
> During math group, Alex became upset when asked to put away the iPad. He started to cry and pushed his worksheet off the table. The teacher reminded him of the break schedule, and Alex calmed down within 3 minutes.

---


**Prompt 1:** “Summarize this incident in 3 sentences suitable for a parent update.”  
**Output:**  
> During math group today, Alex became upset when he was asked to put away the iPad. This frustration led him to cry and push his worksheet off the table. However, the teacher quickly reminded him of the break schedule, and Alex calmed down completely within three minutes.

---

**Prompt 2:** “Identify the antecedent, behavior, and consequence from this note.”  
**Output:**  
> Based on the note, the Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence are as follows:  
> - **Antecedent (A):** The incident occurred during math group when Alex was asked to put away the iPad.  
> - **Behavior (B):** Alex became upset, which manifested as him starting to cry and pushing his worksheet off the table.  
> - **Consequence (C):** The teacher responded by reminding him of the break schedule, which led to Alex calming down completely within three minutes.

---

**Prompt 3:** “Tag this incident with student name, conflict type, and resolution.”  
**Output:**  
> This incident can be tagged as follows:  
> - **Student Name:** Alex  
> - **Conflict Type:** Transition/Activity Change (Alex became upset when asked to put away the iPad)  
> - **Resolution:** Calmed with Prompt/Teacher Redirection (The teacher reminded him of the break schedule, and he calmed down completely within three minutes).

### Reflection
NotebookLM handled the first scenario really well. The summary was clear, neutral in tone, and captured all of the key details without adding anything extra. It correctly identified the antecedent, behavior, and consequence, and even kept the ABC format neat and easy to read. The tags it generated also made sense and matched the event. Overall, this case showed that NotebookLM works fine when the input is clean and well-structured. It felt accurate and professional enough that a teacher could copy it straight into a behavior log with almost no editing.

### ⚠️ Scenario 2 — Edge Case: Multiple Students, Overlapping Events  

### Input
> During group work, Jordan and Mia argued over a shared set of markers. Mia grabbed the markers and refused to share. Jordan yelled and pushed his chair back loudly, startling others. The aide intervened and separated them.

### Prompts & NotebookLM Outputs

**Prompt 1:** “Summarize this note for the school behavior log in 2–3 sentences.”  
**Output:**  
> During group work, Jordan and Mia argued over a shared set of markers after Mia grabbed them and refused to share. Jordan responded to this conflict by yelling and loudly pushing his chair back, which startled other students. An aide intervened in the situation and successfully separated the students.

---

**Prompt 2:** “List each student’s behavior separately.”  
**Output:**  
> **Mia’s Behavior:**  
> - Mia argued over a shared set of markers during group work.  
> - She grabbed the markers.  
> - She refused to share the markers.  
>
> **Jordan’s Behavior:**  
> - Jordan argued over a shared set of markers during group work.  
> - He yelled.  
> - He pushed his chair back loudly (this action startled others).

---

**Prompt 3:** “Generate tags by student name and behavior type.”  
**Output:**  
> The following tags are generated based on the student names and the type of behavior exhibited, drawing upon the provided source:
>| **Student Name** | **Behavior Type Tags** |
>|------------------|------------------------|
>| **Jordan** | Argument/Conflict, Verbal Outburst (Yelled), Physical Disruption (Pushed chair back loudly) |
>| **Mia** | Argument/Conflict, Property/Sharing Dispute, Non-Compliance (Refused to share) |


---

### Reflection
In this scenario with two students, NotebookLM still gave a solid summary but showed some limitations. It managed to separate Jordan’s and Mia’s actions clearly and didn’t mix them up, which was impressive. The tags were specific and relevant, showing that the model could handle multiple actors. However, the summary didn’t capture the emotional tone or classroom impact—it read more like a factual list. This shows that while NotebookLM is accurate in structure, it’s not always sensitive to the interpersonal or emotional side of classroom conflicts that teachers often need to include for context.

### ❌ Scenario 3 — Failure Case: Messy / Incomplete Voice-to-Text Input  

### Input
> Uh so… during reading time, Sam got—like—mad again when someone took his spot. He kinda yelled and threw the book. I told him to take space, he calmed down but later was quiet rest of class.

---

### Prompts & NotebookLM Outputs

**Prompt 1:** “Clean this transcript and summarize what happened.”  
**Output:**  

> Based on the source provided, here is the cleaned transcript and a summary of the events that occurred during Sam's reading time outburst.
> Cleaned Transcript
> The original source material includes disfluencies and informal language. A cleaned version focuses on the core narrative:
> **"During reading time, Sam became angry again when someone took his spot. He yelled and threw the book. [The speaker] told him to take space; he calmed down but later was quiet for the rest of class."**
***
> Summary of What Happened
> The incident occurred during **reading time**. **Sam became angry** ("mad again") after **someone took his spot**. Sam reacted aggressively, demonstrated by the fact that he **"yelled and threw the book"**.
> The speaker intervened, instructing Sam **"to take space"**. Following this intervention, Sam **calmed down**. However, Sam’s behavior shifted dramatically after the outburst, as he **"was quiet rest of class"**.

---

**Prompt 2:** “Identify what triggered the behavior and how the teacher responded.”  
**Output:**  
> The behavior (getting mad, yelling, and throwing a book) was triggered when someone took Sam's spot. This occurred specifically during reading time.  
>
> The teacher (referred to as "I" in the source) responded by telling Sam "to take space". Following this instruction, Sam calmed down. However, after calming down, Sam remained quiet for the rest of class.

---

**Prompt 3:** “What important details seem to be missing that would help clarify the incident?”  
**Output:**  
> Based on the source material provided, several important details are missing that would significantly clarify the context, severity, and overall nature of the incident involving Sam's reading time outburst.
> The existing account is brief, stating that Sam got "mad again" after someone took his spot, leading him to yell and throw the book, after which the teacher told him to "take space", and he subsequently calmed down but was quiet for the rest of class.
> Missing details that would enhance clarification include:
> Context of the Triggering Event
> *   **The Nature of the "Spot":** It is unclear what exactly "his spot" refers to. Was it an officially assigned seat, a favorite cushion, or merely a location he temporarily occupied? Clarification is needed as to whether the spot was genuinely considered his or if the conflict arose from a perceived territorial infringement.
> *   **Identity and Action of the Other Person:** The source only mentions "someone took his spot". Details are missing regarding who this person was (another student, an adult), whether taking the spot was intentional or accidental, and how the other person reacted to Sam's outburst.
> *   **History of Behavior:** The source notes that Sam became "mad **again**", implying a pattern of previous outbursts or emotional reactions. Understanding what happened in those prior incidents would help determine if this incident was typical or an escalation.
> Details of the Behavior and Impact
> *   **Severity of the Outburst:** While Sam "yelled and threw the book", the extent of the disruption is missing. Specifically, how loud was the yelling, and how forcefully was the book thrown?
> *   **Impact of the Thrown Book:** It is unknown where the book landed, whether it was damaged, or if throwing the book endangered or frightened any other students or staff in the classroom.
> Context of the Intervention and Aftermath

> *   **Meaning of "Take Space":** The teacher's intervention was telling Sam "to take space". It is unclear if this refers to a designated cool-down zone, a brief trip out of the room, or simply moving away from the area of conflict.
> *   **Reason for Post-Incident Quietness:** Sam "calmed down but later was quiet rest of class". It is missing whether this quietness was self-imposed (withdrawal, exhaustion), mandated by the teacher as a consequence, or simply a sign of residual distress. Clarifying the duration of "rest of class" is also missing.

### Reflection
This was the toughest test, and NotebookLM’s performance dropped slightly. It did a good job cleaning the messy, voice-like transcript and rewriting it in a readable way, but the summary was mechanical. It pointed out missing information very logically, but that part sounded more like a report than what a teacher would actually write. It didn’t interpret vague language like “mad again” effectively. Overall, it organized the information well but struggled with incomplete or emotional input.

## 🧠 Cross-Scenario Synthesis  
**Prompts:**  
1. “List common triggers across all incidents.”  
2. “Group incidents by type of conflict.”  

**Output:**  
> - **Common Triggers:**  
>   - Being asked to put away a preferred item (Alex and the iPad)  
>   - Conflict over shared materials (Jordan and Mia’s marker dispute)  
>   - Conflict over personal space or possessions (Sam’s spot)  
>
> - **Grouped Conflicts:**  
>   - **Peer Conflict:** Resource or space-related disputes (Jordan, Mia, Sam).  
>   - **Transition/Adult Instruction Conflict:** Reaction to change in activity (Alex).  

---

### Reflection
When all three incidents were uploaded together, NotebookLM grouped them by conflict type and identified common themes like peer conflict and transitions. That was surprisingly helpful and close to what ABCapture aims to automate. However, its summaries were overly academic and not written in a teacher-friendly way. Overall, it showed strong organization but lacked emotional and situational awareness.
