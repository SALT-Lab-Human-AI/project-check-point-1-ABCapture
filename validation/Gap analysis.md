# Gap Analysis

## NotebookLM
The team’s evaluation of NotebookLM showed that while it performs well in summarizing structured text, it lacks several features needed for real classroom documentation. In terms of **accuracy**, NotebookLM generated clear summaries when inputs were well written but often missed emotional tone and contextual nuance. **Reliability** was consistent, though outputs tended to sound formal and detached. Regarding **latency**, the system responded within a reasonable time but required multiple steps such as uploading sources, selecting them, and then prompting which made it slower and less efficient for teachers working in real time.

There was clear **UX friction** since NotebookLM does not support **voice input** and cannot **automatically tag incidents** without manual prompting. These limitations make it impractical for teachers to use while managing a class. In terms of **safety**, the tool relies on Google’s cloud infrastructure, meaning data privacy is dependent on external policies and not explicitly FERPA-compliant. **Cost** is currently not a concern while in beta, but future pricing remains uncertain.  

Overall, the team concluded that NotebookLM is effective for structured text summarization but lacks automation, emotional awareness, and real-time usability. These weaknesses highlight the opportunity for ABCapture to introduce hands-free voice logging, automatic tagging, and secure data management tailored to education settings.
