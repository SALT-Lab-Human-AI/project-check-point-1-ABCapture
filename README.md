### Problem statement and why it matters
Teachers who support autistic students need a fast, accurate way to capture what happened during conflicts, but in real classrooms they can’t stop to type long notes, so details often get lost. When records are messy or missing, it’s harder to spot patterns, adjust supports, and share clear updates with parents and specialists. Our project aims to fix this by making incident logging and organization quick and simple with voice-to-text, auto-summaries, and smart tags - turning a painful admin chore into a simple habit that actually helps students. In the long run, this can improve communication, reduce teacher stress, and create a more supportive environment for students.

### Target users and core tasks
Our target users are teachers working with autistic children, along with school specialists, administrators, and parents who need clear updates. <br> 
The core tasks include logging incidents quickly through voice-to-text, generating auto-summaries so details are easy to understand, organizing notes with AI tags, and making it simple to search and review past events. Together, these tasks save teachers time, reduce stress, and create clearer communication between everyone involved.

### Competitive landscape: existing systems/tools and their shortcomings
There are already tools that help with note-taking, transcription, and behavior tracking, but they don’t fully meet the needs of teachers working with autistic students. General apps like Google Docs or Word require slow manual typing, and transcription tools such as Otter.ai don’t create summaries or organize files with tags. Behavior tracking systems support reporting but are often clunky and not built for real-time classroom use. Overall, existing tools are too generic and lack features like auto-summaries and smart organization, leaving a gap our project aims to fill.

### Initial concept and value proposition
Our initial concept is to build a simple AI-powered tool with two main features: a **Voice-to-Text Incident Logger with Auto-Summary** and an **AI Document/File Organizer that Tags & Summarizes Notes**. Teachers can press a button, describe what happened, and instantly get both a transcript and a short summary of the conflict. The system will then store the record, add tags such as student name, type of conflict, and date, and keep everything organized in one place for easy searching and reviewing. This creates clearer communication with specialists and parents, makes support plans more effective, and turns documentation into a quick, reliable process instead of a stressful chore.
